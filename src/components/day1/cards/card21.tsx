        <Paragraph>
          Now that we have individual arrays for each book property, itâ€™s time
          to combine them into one multidimensional associative array. This will
          make it easier to manage each book as an object-like entity with
          related properties (title, description, cover, price).
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Replace the separate arrays with a single associative array. In your
          index.php, remove the individual arrays and replace them with this
          structure:
