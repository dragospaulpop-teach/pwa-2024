          PHP is an interpreted language, which means that code is executed line-by-line on the server. Thereâ€™s no need to compile PHP code before running it. Other interpreted languages include Ruby, Python, and JavaScript.

        <Paragraph>
          Compiled languages, like C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go etc., are converted into machine code by a compiler before execution. This makes them generally faster but requires a compilation step.

              These languages are compiled into bytecode that is then executed by a runtime environment (Java Virtual Machine for Java, Common Language Runtime for C#).
              They are at the crossroads of interpreted and compiled languages.
