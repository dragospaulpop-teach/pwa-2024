        <Paragraph>
          Now that we have individual arrays for each book property, itâ€™s time
          to combine them into one multidimensional associative array. This will
          make it easier to manage each book as an object-like entity with
          related properties (title, description, cover, price).
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Replace the separate arrays with a single associative array. In your
          index.php, remove the individual arrays and replace them with this
          structure:
        </Paragraph>

        {/* <Paragraph className="flex items-center text-xs">
          <ScrollIcon className="mr-2 h-3 w-3" /> Scroll me
        </Paragraph> */}
        {/* <ScrollArea className="h-[300px]"> */}
        <Code code={code} language="php" />
        {/* </ScrollArea> */}
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
