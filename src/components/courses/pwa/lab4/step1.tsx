          HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request sent to a server is
          independent. The server doesn't retain any information about previous
          requests, so it "forgets" each user after each interaction.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          To maintain a userâ€™s logged-in state across multiple pages, we need a
          way to persist information across requests, which is where sessions
          and tokens come in.
